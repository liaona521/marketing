Google MMM Model – Meridian
GitHub: google/meridian

Google’s Meridian leverages Bayesian probabilistic modeling frameworks. This approach enables uncertainty quantification and scenario analysis, which are critical for strategic business decisions. The popularity of Bayesian methods in business stems from features such as:

Prior Incorporation:
The native use of Bayesian priors serves as an effective model calibration tool, integrating historical data or expert knowledge directly into the model.

Credible Intervals:
Bayesian credible intervals offer an intuitive interpretation of uncertainty in parameter estimates, aiding in more informed decision-making.

Meta MMM Model – Robyn
Documentation: Meta Robyn

Meta’s Robyn also draws on Bayesian principles. For instance, Robyn highlights that its use of Ridge regression is equivalent to a Bayesian regression with a Gaussian prior, while Lasso regression corresponds to a Bayesian regression with a Laplace prior. This blend of regression-based and Bayesian approaches underscores the emphasis on interpretability in their marketing mix models.

From my tests and experience with both platforms, the key reason for adopting these approaches is to ensure that the resulting models—despite the inherent complexity of marketing mix outputs—remain interpretable and actionable. Even with simplified outputs, interpreting the impacts of marketing spend across channels can be challenging.

Comparing with Traditional MMM Approaches: Benefits of ML and DL

While traditional MMM methods rely on regression and Bayesian techniques, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can introduce several benefits:

Nonlinear Relationships:
Deep learning models, such as neural networks, are capable of capturing complex, nonlinear interactions among marketing channels. However, this can come at the expense of the interpretability that is critical for MMM decision-making.

Handling Big Data:
ML techniques like gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost) are adept at managing high-dimensional and large-scale datasets, allowing for more granular attribution and robust predictions.

Feature Engineering & Selection:
ML models can automatically derive interaction effects and identify key features that significantly influence performance. This capability is particularly useful when integrating MMM with multi-touch attribution strategies.

Hybrid Approaches:
A promising direction is blending traditional econometric models with ML/DL components. For example, one might use a deep neural network to capture residual nonlinearity after establishing a linear MMM baseline. This hybrid approach combines the interpretability of econometric models with the predictive power of ML/DL techniques.
