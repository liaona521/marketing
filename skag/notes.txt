i recently implemented Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs) strategy for one of clients using a Google Ads script.
SKAGs means each ad group contains only one keyword (usually in exact or phrase match). the performance indicated SKAGs bring a lot traffic with lower cost 
because :
1. Improved Ad Relevance
Since each ad group contains only one specific keyword, you can create highly relevant ad copy that matches the user's search query exactly.
This increases Quality Score, leading to lower CPC (Cost-Per-Click) and better performance

2. Higher Click-Through Rate and lower CPC
Since the search query and ad text match more closely, users are more likely to click your ad.
Google Ads often bolds matching keywords in search results, making them stand out more.

however it required a lot management resources to monitor and control. so wrote a google script to automate it. 
here's part of core code:

function main() {
  // Replace with your target campaign name or use AdsApp.campaigns().get() to loop over all campaigns.
  var campaignName = "Campaign Name";
  var campaignIterator = AdsApp.campaigns()
    .withCondition("Name = '" + campaignName + "'")
    .get();
    
  if (campaignIterator.hasNext()) {
    var campaign = campaignIterator.next();
    
    // List of keywords for which to create SKAGs
    var keywords = ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"];
    
    // Loop through each keyword and create a SKAG
    for (var i = 0; i < keywords.length; i++) {
      var keyword = keywords[i];
      
      // Create a new ad group named after the keyword
      var adGroupName = keyword + " SKAG";
      var adGroupOperation = campaign.newAdGroupBuilder()
        .withName(adGroupName)
        .withCpc(1.00)  // Set your default CPC bid
        .build();
        
      var adGroup = adGroupOperation.getResult();
      
      // Add the keyword as an exact match
      adGroup.createKeyword("[" + keyword + "]");
      
      // Optionally, add negative keywords to prevent overlap
      // For example, if you want to add all other keywords as negatives
      for (var j = 0; j < keywords.length; j++) {
        if (j !== i) {
          adGroup.createNegativeKeyword("[" + keywords[j] + "]");
        }
      }
      
      // Optionally, create ads within the ad group that are tailored to the keyword
      // Example: create a text ad
      adGroup.newAd()
        .expandedTextAdBuilder()
        .withHeadlinePart1("Buy " + keyword + " Now")
        .withHeadlinePart2("Best Deals Available")
        .withDescription("Find the best " + keyword + " deals online.")
        .withFinalUrl("http://www.example.com")
        .build();
    }
  } else {
    Logger.log("Campaign not found: " + campaignName);
  }
}
